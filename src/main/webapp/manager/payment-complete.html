        You have successfully completed the preapproval process for your Anchor Tab
        subscription. WePay will confirm shortly that everthing is kosher with your
        Credit Card, and will send us a message letting us know. In fact, it should
        only take the amount of time that is required to read this message. :)

        By the time you're done reading this, your new subscription should be active
        and rolling. So, what are you waiting for?
