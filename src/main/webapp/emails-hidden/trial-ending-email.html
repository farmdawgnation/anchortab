      Hey buddy,
    </p>

    <p>
      We're writing to let you know that your Anchor Tab trial of the
      "<span class="plan-name">Bacon</span>" plan will be ending in three days.
      We hope you've enjoyed getting to know Anchor Tab, and that you've seen a substantial
      benefit from embedding the tab on your site.
    </p>

    <p class="no-billing-info">
      Since there's no billing information on file as of the time of this writing, you'll
      want to log into the <a href="http://anchortab.com/manager">Tab Manager</a> as quickly
      as possible to ensure that your service isn't interrupted.
    </p>

    <p class="billing-info">
      As your billing information is already on file, you'll be billed as soon as your trial is
      over.
    </p>

    <p>
      As always, feel free to hit the reply button on this email if you feel the need to
      talk to a real human.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sincerely,<br>
      The Anchor Tab Team
