      Danger, Will Robinson!
    </p>

    <p class="will-bill-again">
      We tried to bill the credit card you have on file today in the amount of
      <span class="bill-amount">$5.00</span>, but the charge failed to go through.
      Please log into the <a href="http://anchortab.com/manager">Tab Manager</a> and update
      your Credit Card information in our system. We'll try to bill you again on
      <span class="next-payment-attempt">Oct 1</span>.
    </p>

    <p class="will-not-bill-again">
      After several attempts to bill your card for your Anchor Tab subscription, we have
      been less successful than a sailboat with termites. Your subscription has been removed
      from your account and all tabs have been deactivated.
