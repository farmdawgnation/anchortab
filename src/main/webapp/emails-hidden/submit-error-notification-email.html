      <strong>Heads up:</strong> Over the last 24 hours, Anchor Tab has had issues trying
      to submit emails to one of the email services hooked up to your tabs. We logged the
      following errors within the last 24 hours.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li class="error">
        While trying to submit the email <span class="email">bacon@frmr.com</span> at
        <span class="time">10/20/13 11:00:00 PM UTC</span> on the tab "<span class="tab-name">
        My Awesome Tab</span>", we got the following error: <span class="error-message">It failed.</span>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Normally errors like this will occur because your subscription or list information
      has changed on the email marketing service you're using. You can usually fix these
      errors by logging into the <a href="https://anchortab.com/manager">Tab Manager</a>,
      finding the tabs named above, clicking edit, then making sure the correct list is
      selected, and then clicking save. If you find you can't select the correct list, you
      may need to disconnect and reconnect your email marketing service to Anchor Tab.
    </p>

    <p>
      To test and make sure it's working, it may be a good idea to go to your website
      and try to submit an email then see if it comes through.
