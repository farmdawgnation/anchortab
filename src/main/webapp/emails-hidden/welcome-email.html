    <p>Hello there!</p>

    <p>
      I wanted to take the opportunity to welcome you to Anchor Tab. I'm really thrilled that
      you've decided to give us a spin. Any emails that come from us always have a real sender
      address, so you can hit reply to any of them to get a hold of the team.
    </p>

    <p>
      First thing is first: To help get you started, we've been working on assembling some brief articles that we're
      calling the Anchor Tab Guide. You can read them at <a href="http://guide.anchortab.com">http://guide.anchortab.com</a>.
      Hopefully you'll find them helpful. Please let us know if there's anything you see that we could add.
    </p>

    <p>
      Second, if you have a moment to spare would you mind helping us out? While it's fresh on your mind, could you reply to
      this email and tell us what it is that convinced you to create an Anchor Tab account? What is it that you saw that sold you
      on us being worth your time compared to other solutions? We're working on the next round of improvements to
      our landing page and the product itself. Any help you can give us about what piqued your interest would be awesome.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, on behalf of myself and the entire Anchor Tab Team, welcome to the family. If there's ever anything we can do
      we're just an email away.
    </p>

    <p>
      Onward and upward,
    </p>

    <p>
      Matt Farmer<br>
      Lead Engineer, Anchor Tab
