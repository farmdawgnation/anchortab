    <h3 class="light-rope">About Us</h3>

    <p>
      Anchor Tab is a joint venture between Matt Farmer, a Software Engineer based in the Atlanta, GA,
      area, and Cirion Group, a business consulting firm based in Athens, GA. We're all individuals
      passionate about what we're doing, and with srong ideals that are continually influencing the
      direction we take with Anchor Tab. Success or failure we have decided that from the start this
      business will be open, it will be fun, and it will be human.
    </p>

    <p>
      We're open because we have benefited from open technology and give back to those communities that
      have helped us get where we are. We're fun because life is too short to take yourself too seriously,
      and we're human in how we deal with our customers - both on days when things are going well and on
      days they aren't. So, if you'd like to get to know the team, read on.
    </p>

      Matt Farmer is the Lead Engineer for Anchor Tab. He graduated from the 
      <a href="http://uga.edu" target="_blank">superior institution of higher
      learning in the state of Georgia</a> in 2011 with his Bachelor's
      degree in Computer Science. Throughout college, and for several months thereafter,
      Matt worked for various web consulting firms to solve a variety of problems for
      clients. In November 2011, he made the jump out of the consulting business to join
      the startup world. He can typically be found sipping a caffeinated beverage of some
      kind, rocking out to an obscure band, and is involved in a rage of open source,
      startup, and side projects - none of which include tap dancing. He blogs quasi-
      regularly on his personal blog,
      <a href="http://farmdawgnation.com" target="_blank">Farmdawg Nation</a>, and has
      periodically been observed in the wild (by discrete film crews, of course) shipping
      awesome things on his <a href="http://github.com/farmdawgnation" target="_blank">GitHub
      account</a>.
