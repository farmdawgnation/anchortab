    <h3 class="light-rope">About Us</h3>

    <p>
      Anchor Tab is a joint venture between Crazy Goat Creative, a boutique consulting and product company,
      area, and Cirion Group, a business consulting firm. We're all individuals
      passionate about what we're doing, and with strong ideals that are continually influencing the
      direction we take with Anchor Tab. Success or failure we have decided that from the start this
      business will be open, it will be fun, and it will be human.
    </p>

    <p>
      We're open because we have benefited from open technology and give back to those communities that
      have helped us get where we are. We're fun because life is too short to take yourself too seriously,
      and we're human in how we deal with our customers - both on days when things are going well and on
      days they aren't. So, if you'd like to get to know the team, read on.
    </p>

      Matt worked for various web consulting firms to solve a variety of problems for
      clients. In November 2011, he made the jump out of the consulting business to join
      the startup world. He can typically be found sipping a caffeinated beverage of some
      kind, rocking out to an obscure band, and is involved in a rage of open source,
      startup, and side projects - none of which include tap dancing. He blogs quasi-
      regularly on his personal blog,
      <a href="http://farmdawgnation.com" target="_blank">Farmdawg Nation</a>, and has
      periodically been observed in the wild (by discreet film crews, of course) shipping
      awesome things on his <a href="http://github.com/farmdawgnation" target="_blank">GitHub
      account</a>.

    <p class="bio">
      Jonathan Graf is a designer based out of Fort Worth, Texas. He is responsible for the branding and look
      and feel of the site. We have genuinely enjoyed the opportunity of getting to work with
      Jonathan, and would recommend him to anyone who, like us, has a great idea that they need
      branding and design work done for. Although he is not a formal team member and was working as
      a consultant, we felt it would be wrong not to acknowledge the brilliant work he's done for us
      in getting our first version of Anchor Tab out the door. We would be happy to talk to anyone
      about our experience in working with Jonathan. Feel free to drop us a line. You can contact Jonathan directly
      through <a href="http://www.grajon.com/" target="_blank">his website</a>.
