    <h3 class="light-rope">Terms of Service</h3>

    <p>This is an agreement between you and Cirion Group, LLC, related to the Anchor Tab service.</p>

    <p>You want to use the Anchor Tab service and Cirion Group wants to provide it to you so that you can increase your email readership.</p>

    <p>Cirion Group will provide whatever functionality Anchor Tab has and you may choose to use that functionality. That functionality may change or go away at the discresion of Cirion Group. Upon any such change being decided, customers will be notified and have an opportunity to change or cancel their service before being billed for a reduced feature set, unless the feature that was removed or disabled was done to protect the integrity of the Anchor Tab service as a whole - in which case active customers affected by this decision will have their current month&#8217;s bill pro-rated by an amount that the Cirion Group believes accurately reflects percentage value lost from not having that feature available.</p>

    <p>You agree that you will make no claims against Cirion Group or anyone else associated with Anchor Tab for any reason including features going away, the service being down, or any other reason. If you wind up finding a lawyer that makes a claim that somehow Cirion owes you something related to Anchor Tab, you agree that the total amount you can recover under any legal theory is the total amount that you&#8217;ve actually paid Cirion and Cirion has received from you for the Anchor Tab service.</p>

    <p>Cirion is a bailee of any materials you make available for publishing via the Anchor Tab service, including images and text. You grant to Cirion, for the period of publishing, all rights and licenses necessary for Anchor Tab to publish the aforementioned content.</p>

    <p>When your account is terminated (either by your choice or by Cirion&#8217;s choice), Cirion will make reasonable efforts to render inaccessible the information that it is acting as bailee for from systems that Cirion has access to. You grant Cirion any ongoing rights that are necessary related to the bits that are inaccessible yet may still represent your property. You acknowledge that bits of your information will continue to exist after account termination on backup systems, disk platters, and other places and there&#8217;s no practical way to destroy that information.</p>

    <p>You agree to only publish information that you have the right to publish. This means that you&#8217;re not publishing someone else&#8217;s copyrighted work and you&#8217;re not publishing stuff that&#8217;s illegal in the US or the EU. If Cirion Group or any party involved in the Anchor Tab project has legal action threatened against them for items you publish, you agree to defend them and hold them harmless. Cirion also has the right in its sole discretion to remove your site from Telgram if it thinks your content or usage of the service is offensive, threatens the availability of the service for other customers, or in any other way could potentially compromise the business goals of the Anchor Tab project.</p>

    <p>These terms and the entity operating Anchor Tab will change. When these terms change, you&#8217;ll get an email to that effect. You&#8217;ll have the choice of agreeing to the new terms or terminating your account with Anchor Tab.</p>

    <p>The choice of law for these terms is the law in Athens, GA. All legal action related to Anchor Tab will take place in Athens, GA. If part of this agreement is found unenforceable, the rest of it stands. This is an integrated agreement unless there is a document signed by you and Cirion Group.</p>

    <p>This excellent legal agreement was based off of one made by David Pollak for <a href="http://telegr.am" target="_blank">Telegr.am</a>. Go and show him some love for being awesome by giving Telegr.am a try.</p>
